# TimelineForUnityButtplug.io
A Unoffical Plugin using Unity's Timeline tool to create patterns for Buttplug.io.

# WORK IN PROGRESS: 
Please report any bugs via Issues! I do not recommend using this code in a production project currently.

## Setup:
1. Download and install Buttplug.io for Unity (https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-unity)
2. Either download the source code, or use the included Asset Package.
3. Add my version of StartServiceProcessAndScan into the scene.
4. Add a Playable Director into the scene

Look at the demo scene for a demostration on how the script works.

## TO DO:

Clean up codebase.

Fix crashing issue upon closing compiled game. (Works fine in Play Mode.)

Add proper doccumentation.
